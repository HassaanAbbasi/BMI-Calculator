# BMI-Calculator
This repo is used to host my body mass index (BMI) calculator. I use Python and PostGreSQL to collect and store information from users in a database. The information collected includes the user's height, weight, and email address. 

Once the data is submitted, the user automatically receives an email that contains the following statistics: their calculated BMI, what their BMI means, and what the average BMI in the database is.

This web app is served on Heroku with Flask.
